            <p id="aboutright-p">I am Christabella Wijaya, you can call me Bella. I am currently a first-year design student at Bina Nusantara University. With my background in design, I am becoming more eager to create a good website that could fulfill the user's needs. That is the reason I joined BNCC (Bina Nusantara Computer Club) to learn various programming languages, especially front-end development. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Alongside that, I am also passionate about other organizational activities. I joined the 2021 National English Olympics and 2022 Asian English Olympics as the committee. Moreover, I am an education counselor at Bina Nusantara University. I have gained many lessons about teamwork, problem-solving, and event organizing from those experiences. When it comes to working individually, I am a hardworking person and always give my best fight to my work. </p>
